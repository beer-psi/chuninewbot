   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
1. Copy `bot.example.ini` to `bot.ini` and fill in values based on the comments.
2. `poetry install` and `poetry shell`
3. Run `python dbutils.py create` to create the database.
4. Run `python dbutils.py update chunirec` to populate the song database. For
   this to work, `credentials.chunirec_token` **must** be set in `bot.ini`. A
   pre-populated database is also provided

   for your convenience.
