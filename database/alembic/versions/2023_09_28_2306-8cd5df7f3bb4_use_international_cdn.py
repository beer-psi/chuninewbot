"""international_only

Another migration in the series of I Had To Do This Because CHUNITHM Has International
Exclusives. This flag in the song entry marks that the bot should use

    https://chunithm-net-eng.com/mobile/images/

instead of

    https://new.chunithm-net.com/chuni-mobile/html/mobile/img

for jacket URLs. It might do some other behavior in the future, if I bother to add support
for JP people.
