"""add sdvxin.end_index

Some WORLD'S END songs have multiple versions. While they have different IDs in other
databases, they share the same ID in sdvx.in.
This column is used to distinguish it. The new sdvx.in URL for WORLD'S END will be
    "https://sdvx.in/chunithm/{difficulty}/{sdvxin_id}end{end_index or ''}.htm"
