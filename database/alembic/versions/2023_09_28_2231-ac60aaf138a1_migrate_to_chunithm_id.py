"""migrate to chunithm_id

Depending on chunirec has made fetching data for this bot simple, but it is also a pain
in the ass when CHUNITHM International ver. decide to drop an update that JP doesn't
have (yet). As a result, we are migrating away from using chunirec IDs altogether.

Wear your seatbelts, this is a primary key migration.
